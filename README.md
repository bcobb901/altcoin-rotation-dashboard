# Altcoin Season Rotation Dashboard (Public-Data Edition)

A Streamlit dashboard that pulls together cycle-top signals, BTC/ETH dominance, ETH/BTC, narratives, and your watchlist â€” using **only public data sources** so it runs without API keys.

## Whatâ€™s Included (no keys needed)
- **Pi Cycle Top** (embed)
- **MVRV Z-Score** (embed)
- **Fear & Greed Index** via alternative.me
- **Google Trends** embed for "how to buy crypto"
- **BTC & ETH Dominance** via CoinGecko global API
- **ETH/BTC** via CoinGecko simple price
- **CoinGecko Categories** (24h change) table
- **DeFiLlama Narrative Tracker** (embed)
- **TradingView** quick links for your watchlist (SOL, SUI, RNDR, ONDO, TAO, etc.)

## Optional (later, with keys)
- **CoinGlass Altcoin Season Index** â€” add your `coinglassSecret` key in the app sidebar when you have it.
